        <h3>The Turing Test</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" proposing that if a machine could convince a human it was human through conversation, it could be considered "intelligent." This becomes the foundational question of AI.</p>
      <div class="tech-box">
        <strong>KEY FIGURE:</strong> Alan Turing<br>
        <strong>CONCEPT:</strong> Can machines think?
